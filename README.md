# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to analyze wholesale customer purchasing behaviors. We explore clustering methods and dimensionality reduction to uncover hidden patterns in the data and provide actionable insights.

## Project Outcomes
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and trends.

K-Means Clustering: Identifying customer segments based on purchasing behavior.

Hierarchical Clustering: Understanding customer relationships through dendrogram visualization.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dimensionality and identifying the most influential features.

### Duration:
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes

### Project Description:

Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing

Import and clean dataset.

Handle missing values and outliers.

Perform feature scaling and transformation.

Identify correlations between features.

Unsupervised Learning Models

K-Means Clustering: Determines optimal customer segments using the Elbow Method & Silhouette Score.

Hierarchical Clustering: Applies different linkage methods to visualize customer similarity.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces feature dimensions and selects key influential components.

Insights & Visualizations

Feature Importance Analysis: PCA revealed that Grocery, Frozen, and Fresh Products contributed the most to variance.

Optimal Clusters Selection: K-Means clustering showed distinct spending behaviors among customers.

Dendrogram Analysis: Hierarchical clustering indicated continuous distribution patterns rather than hard divisions.

This project provides valuable business insights by identifying customer spending patterns, highlighting key features that influence purchasing decisions, and optimizing segmentation strategies.
